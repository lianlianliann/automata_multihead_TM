    <p>Our software is a Fake News Detector built using a Multihead Turing Machine (MHTM). It analyzes short Facebook posts and classifies them as CREDIBLE or SUSPICIOUS based on rule-based detection of linguistic patterns found in fake news.</p>
    <p>
        The system uses three parallel scanning heads, each checking a different type of pattern:

        <ul>
            <li>Head 1 – Emotional & Lexical Cues: Detects exaggerated, shocking, and manipulative words. </li>

            <li> Head 2 – Structural Patterns: Looks for excessive punctuation, ALL CAPS words, and unusual text formatting.</li>

            <li>  Head 3 – Repetition: Identifies repeated words or phrases that may indicate deceptive emphasis.</li>
        </ul>

        After scanning, the system produces:

        A classification (Credible or Suspicious)

        A confidence score based on detected patterns

        A detailed explanation showing which features triggered the detection

        This creates a transparent, deterministic, and easy-to-understand tool that demonstrates how automata theory—specifically Multihead Turing Machines—can be applied to real-world fake news detection without machine learning.
